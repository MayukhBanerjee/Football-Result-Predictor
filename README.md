# Football-Score-Predictor
This is a Football Score predictor using machine learning where I have implemented the following learnings
1) Collecting the dataset from Kaggle.
2) Cleaning the dataset accoriding to the desired predictions for the same match prediction model.

      -> This consisted of adding new columns, specified to the model training.
   
      -> Converting object data into numeric , in order for it to be understood by the training model.
  
      -> Splitting the data into training and test sets.
  
4) TRAINING ALGORITHM USED :- Random Forest Classifier
5) Learning the matches played in the season of 2022 - 2023 still ongoing and the predicting the scores alongside the already occured instance.
