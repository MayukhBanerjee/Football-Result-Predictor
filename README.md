# Football-Score-Predictor
This is a Football Score predictor using machine learning where I have implemented the following learnings
1) Collecting the dataset from kaggle.
2) Cleaning the dataset accoriding to the desired predictions for the same match prediction model.
  -> This consisted of adding new columns, specified to the model training.
  -> Converting object data into numeric , in order for it to be understood by the training model.
  -> Splitting the data into training and test sets.
3) TRAINING ALGORITHM USED :- Random Forest Classifier
